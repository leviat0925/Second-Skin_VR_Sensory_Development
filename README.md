# Second-Skin_VR_Sensory_Development
"This project embodies posthumanism in VR—combining sight, sound, and touch to blur the line between humans and machines, creating a truly immersive interactive experience. Thank you for exploring Second skin Immersion with me."

## Project Content [Video](Elment2_ProjectVideo.mp4)
- Virtual Part develop with Unreal Engine 5.4.2
- Physical Part develop with Arduino (ESP32 DEV)
- 3D Print with Blender
